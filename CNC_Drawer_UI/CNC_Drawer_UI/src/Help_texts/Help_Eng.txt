Com. COM port, which is created when connecting the Arduino controller. Information is transferred to the controller through it.

IMPORTANT! Before clicking the Start button, make sure that you have selected the COM port that Arduino created in the drop-down list.
To make sure:
- connect the Arduino to the USB connector of the computer
- open Control Panel => Device Manager => Ports (COM and LPT).
- find the desired COM port
If the COM port is missing, you need to install the COM port driver.
To do this, open the CNCDrawer\Driver\CH341SER folder and run Setup.exe and click Install.	
Browse. The Browse button is used to select an image file on the computer. It is advisable to use images in files with the PNG extension. When processing images in other formats, inaccuracies or errors may occur.	
Zoom. Image magnification factor. Scaling is performed by increasing the length of each line and the distance between the lines. Thus, the image size increases = Width*Zoom, Height*Zoom.	
Filter. The coefficient that is needed to convert the image from color or gray to black and white. By changing the Filter value, you can clean the white background from unnecessary "noise" pixels and get a clear black and white image. The coefficient determines the border between white and black. Anything less than this value is considered black, and anything more is considered white.	
Start. Start drawing. The process continues until the image is drawn. To interrupt drawing, you need to close the application by clicking the X button in the upper right corner of the application window.
